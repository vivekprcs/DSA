/**
 * Given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries
 * as low and high, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [low, high].
 * Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements
 * that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a
 * descendant). It can be proven that there is a unique answer.
 * 
 * Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. Note that the root may
 * change depending on the given bounds.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2
 * Output: [1,null,2]
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [3,0,4,null,2,null,null,1], low = 1, high = 3
 * Output: [3,2,null,1]
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree in the range [1, 104].
 * 0 <= Node.val <= 104
 * The value of each node in the tree is unique.
 * root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
 * 0 <= low <= high <= 104
